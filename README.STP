I had to make the follwing changes to STP in order to obtain better
performance:

1. Switch the STP back-end to CRYPTOMINISAT. This can be achieved by
modifying STP::TopLevelSTP in src/STPManager/STP.cpp.

2. Alter the multiply variant to 1 (the simplest). This can be achieved
by modifying BitBlaster<BBNode,BBNodeManagerT>::BBMult in
src/to-sat/BitBlaster.cpp.

With these changes, searching for a solution of length 6 for 64-bit
FNV-1 only took around 90 seconds on a 2.4GHz Intel Core2 Duo. Without
them, the same search took approximately 30 minutes.
